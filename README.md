# CRUD-Application
Student CRUD is a simple browser app to create, read, update, and delete student records (ID, name, contact, class). Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it uses localStorage to persist data, no server required. Clean Bootstrap UI, inline validation, edit locking on ID, and confirm delete keep data consistent and easy to manage. Offline-ready app.
